## Introduction
This is our project "Geometric Deep Learning for 3D Shape Correspondence".
It explores several recent methods on 3D Shape correspondence, including: 
- CNN methods with local operators e.g. Geodesic CNN [1] and MoNet[2]
- methods evaluating functional maps on geometry e.g. Geometric Functional Maps [3] and
- our main focus (baseline method), [DiffusionNet](https://github.com/nmwsharp/diffusion-net/tree/master)[4].
## Code and Data
The README in each folder explains the prerequisite development environment, code and data needed.
## Evaluation
Our code is evaluated on the [FAUST Humans dataset](https://faust-leaderboard.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/)[5], a standard realistic benchmark for 3D Shape Correspondence methods.
