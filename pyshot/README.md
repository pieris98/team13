# `pyshot`: a Python interface for the SHOT descriptor ([ORIGINAL REPOSITORY OF pyshot](https://github.com/uhlmanngroup/pyshot):

The original implementation originates from the author of [1], [2], [3].

It has been marginally modified to interface the computation of the SHOT
descriptors with other languages.

This project makes use of Cython to bind the implementation to a simple Python
interface.

## Installation step
Before installing, you need to meet some C/C++ *and* Python dependencies:
### ⚠ C and C++ dependencies 
You need `Eigen3`, `FLANN` and `LZ4` to be able to compile the C++
implementation. 

Please refer to your distribution's package manager.
Example for `Debian`-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt install libflann-dev libeigen3-dev lz4
```
### Python dependencies
I recommend using a `conda` environment to keep things clean. That being said, depending on versions of `libstdc++` in your `conda` env, you might not get `pyshot` to work *even if you successfully build it*.
I recommend the following steps (tested on Python version `3.10` & `3.8.8`):
 1. check your `libstdcxx-ng` version by `conda list libstdcxx-ng` and if necessary run `conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng==11.2.0` (tested libstdc++ version to avoid [the _ZSt28__throw_bad_array_new_lengthv error](https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan/issues/294) due to conda-system libstdc++ mismatch)
 2. within your `conda` environment (if you're using one) run `pip` `install -r requirements.txt` for tested versions of `Cython`, `setuptools`, `numpy` that work for building `pyshot` 
3. Clone the repository (this is a fork from [this branch of uhlmann group's implementation](https://github.com/uhlmanngroup/pyshot/commit/18ff0f25768cf93c62dba847fa002944518a0f2f) (in case it gets updated, although I doubt it due to the repo's inactivity).
4. Install the project using the source
```bash
git clone <this repo url>
cd pyshot
# Manage your virtual env here.
# You can use (recommended), but don't need a conda env.
pip install .
```

### Usage

Typical snippet:

```python
import pyshot
import numpy as np

### ...

vertices: np.array =  # ... a np.array of shape (n, 3)
faces: np.array =  # ... a np.array of shape (m, 3)

# a np.array of shape (n, n_descr)
shot_descrs: np.array = pyshot.get_descriptors(
	vertices,
	faces,
	radius=100,
	local_rf_radius=100,
	# The following parameters are optional
	min_neighbors=3,
	n_bins=20,
	double_volumes_sectors=True,
	use_interpolation=True,
	use_normalization=True,
)
```

See [`example_pyshot.py`](./example_pyshot.py).


## Installation step for development mode

 - Clone the repository.
 - Install the project using the source in [editable mode](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode)
```bash
git clone <this repo url>
cd pyshot
# Manage your virtual env here.
# You can use, but don't need a conda env.
pip install --editable . -v
```

    abstract = {This paper deals with local 3D descriptors for surface matching. First, we categorize existing methods into two classes: Signatures and Histograms. Then, by discussion and experiments alike, we point out the key issues of uniqueness and repeatability of the local reference frame. Based on these observations, we formulate a novel comprehensive proposal for surface representation, which encompasses a new unique and repeatable local reference frame as well as a new 3D descriptor. The latter lays at the intersection between Signatures and Histograms, so as to possibly achieve a better balance between descriptiveness and robustness. Experiments on publicly available datasets as well as on range scans obtained with Spacetime Stereo provide a thorough validation of our proposal.},
